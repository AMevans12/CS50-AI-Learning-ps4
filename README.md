# CS50 AI Week 4: Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two projects from Week 4 of the CS50 AI course, focusing on different aspects of machine learning: the Shopping project and the Nim game. Both projects demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms and techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Projects

### 1. Shopping

The Shopping project involves predicting whether online shoppers will complete a purchase based on various features such as page views, session duration, and visitor type. The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify the data.

#### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of various classification algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.

### 2. Nim

The Nim project is a reinforcement learning application where an AI learns to play the game of Nim. The AI improves its strategy through self-play, utilizing Q-learning to make optimal decisions.

#### Key Features:
- Implementation of Q-learning algorithm.
- Training the AI through self-play.
- Evaluation of the AI's performance against human players.
